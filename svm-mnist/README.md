# SVM_MNIST
SVM and SVC classifier on MNIST package using sckit-learn

We use the MNIST database of handwritten digits, which has a training set of 60,000 examples, and a test set of 10,000 examples. Each image in both the training and test dataset is a 28x28 pixel image centered in using center of mass of the pixels, and translating the image so as to position this point at the center of the 28x28 field.

The aim of the project is to use SVC and LinearSVC classifiers provided in the library 'sklearn' to classify MNIST dataset.
